              <p>An experienced Pizza lover once told me that finding a really good pizza in Nairobi is like finding a lost friend on Moi Avenue. It is a nearly impossible task. I couldn’t agree more.

                However there are restaurants and fat food joints that are really trying their best in delivering the very best of the ‘unhealthy-yet-loved substance’.
                
                Most people who have traveled to Europe and the USA say that Kenya has terrible pizza but we are here to prove them wrong. There are a few places in Nairobi with amazing pizza choices.</p>
